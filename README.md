Julia wrapper for <a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a>. 

"HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization of a sphere. As suggested in the name, this pixelization produces a subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same surface area as every other pixel." (source: http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/)

Note that this is very much a work in progress. Only a small part of the HEALPix library is currently wrapped.
